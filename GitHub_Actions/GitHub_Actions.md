## What is GitHub Actions? How is it Different from Other CI/CD Tools?
**GitHub Actions** is GitHubâ€™s integrated CI/CD tool that automates workflows like building, testing, and deploying code.

## Key Features of GitHub Actions
* **Integration with GitHub**: Native integration with repositories, pull requests, and issues.

## How GitHub Actions Differs from Other CI/CD Tools:

| Aspect | GitHub Actions | Other CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Integration** | Deep integration with GitHub repositories. | Requires external integrations for GitHub or GitLab.|
| **Setup**	| Easy setup within GitHub itself. | Often needs separate installation and configuration. |
| **Hosting** | Hosted directly on GitHub servers. | Hosted externally or self-managed (e.g., Jenkins). |
| **Cost** | Free for public repos, limited free-tier minutes for private repos. | Varies by provider; often requires infrastructure costs. |
| **Flexibility** | Ideal for small to medium projects.	| More suitable for complex enterprise-grade workflows. |
